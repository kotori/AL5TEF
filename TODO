_NOTES_

1.) Upon initialization, if you tap a keyboard arrow key, the player's sprite will run in place until a key is tapped again.

2.) When moving from screen to screen (map to map) the transition between the two should be smooth. This will probably require the use
     of triggers when creating the MAP object.

3.) Implement new TMX map loading class, this will replace the current map loading routines.

4.) Implement the TMX map loading class to also draw the loaded map, based upon its layer
 ex:  void drawMap( int layer );
    This should ease drawing the map's individual layers
 ex: MAIN DRAWING ROUTINE
  1.) draw layer 1
  2.) draw layer 2
  3.) draw player
  4.) draw all other NPCs, misc sprites.
  5.) draw layer 3 - final.
